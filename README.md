	including choosing to exit the program
	
### Feature 2:
	
  - Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
	
### Feature 3:
	
  - Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
	
### Feature 4:
	
  - Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
	
  - Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.
